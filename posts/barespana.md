The Bar España is a classic by the now bronze scuplture of old Alamo
tree that was centre of Miraflores.
(this was the place that the waiter said he had seen my wallet on
"Neighbours of Miraflores" so great bunch!)

Has a Racion (shared plate size) of morcilla that PT can recommend.
Also the pulpo (octopus) is estupendous here (comes on mashed potato)!
