Madrid is a big City - got great shopping if your in to that but can be
expensive and hot! It will be 5 C more than Miraflores normally so
best to go in evening.

Parking is also expensive so we find best option is to take 725 bus to
Plaza Castilla (3 Euros, 1 hr) then get on metro (red plastic ticket
you can but 10 trips for ~8 euros) and explore that way.

La Puerto de Sol is the centre of Spain and everything is measured in
kilometeres from here (unless your in Barcelona but that's NOT Spain!)

The Plaza Mayor (old toen center) is close to this as well as the
Royal Palcae and the Gran Via is good to walk alone for the shops etc
but as expensive as shit in middle of town. YMMV.

The Prado is the national museum which is ok if your in to that.
