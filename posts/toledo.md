Toledo is where the best armour for aspiring knights can be found.
Also if you want a sword then this is your place.
It is about an 1 1/2 hours from La Trocha in car. And best to leve
early as parking is cheap in the morning (2$ until midday) plus its a
lot cooler

A walled town on top of a hill surrounded by rivers its pretty awesome
and heaps to see and do - plus shop. Cathedrals and churches for Africa.
