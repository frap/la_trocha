The tap water is fine to drink. However if you want to be old school
and do it like the original Miraflorean's - like our 88 year old
neighbour Lucia - then head up to the Fuente (spring) del Brezal on the road to
Canencia (up M629 about 2 kilometers from us) and fill up your water bottles.

More satisfying and like a placebo it tastes a whole lot better!
