At the top of Morcuera is the start/end of the Cuerda Larga a 21 km
walk over the Guadarama range to Navacerrada. You can drive up to the
top and its about an hour walk from the Morcuera road (1800m) to the
tops about ~2000m. Lots of Spaniards do the Cuerda Larga (long Cord) on a full
moon but probably best to start in Navacerrada and end up at Morcuera.

You will need good sand shoes as stoney and some rock hopping. Also
there are Iberian Goat up there and they are pretty cool to see.
