At the top of Morcuera is the start/end of the Cuerda Larga a 21 km
walk over the Guadaramma range to Navacerrada. You can drive up to the
top and its about an hour walk from the Morcuera road (1800m) to the
tops about ~2000m. Lots of Spaniards do the Cuerda Larga (long Cord) on a full
moon but probably best to start in Navacerrada and end up at Morcuera.

You will need good sandshoes as stoney and some rock hopping. Also the
Iberian Goat so they are pretty cool to see.
