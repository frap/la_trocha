If your using the house then its all free, We just ask you leave it
in a better state than you found it. What that really means is make
sure you do your dishes, clean the sheets used, and if you have time
and its not too hot then a bit of weeding wouldn't go a miss so it 
looks lived in. (actually update there's a leaf blower and edge
trimmer (both 2 stroke the black container has already premixed 2
stroke in it) - so if you can make sure the weeds are cut back and
leafs blown away it would be appreciated)

PS: Don't leave anything in the freezer as the power can go off at anytime!
