El Escorial is king Filipe II's palace. Pretty impressive palace and
grounds you can walk around. The Philipnes are named after King
Filipe. I think he may have been overthrown by Napolean but odnt quote me. 

The Valley of the Fallen is close (big Cross) on hill. Its where Franco was buried until the latest left
government finally dug him up and stuck him with a stake.
