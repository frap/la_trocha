LaGuardia is our favourite place in Spain. An old walled town that was
never conquered as they had tunnels under all the houses it is in the
middle of la Rioja district (famous red wine variety of Spain).

LaGuardia has the best food and wine in Spain which is impressive as you'll see Spain
is fucken awesome already!

Stay in one of the renovated house within the town - It'll cost ya but
worth it. We stayed at Manor House and can recommend it.

About 3.5 hours in car from La Trocha. Add Bilbao or San Sebastian
(both 1 hour form here) and maybe the Asturias region (can recommend
Cagnas de Onis) if you want to add an extra few days of awesomeness.

La Ciega, has an awesome bodega (winery) in same style (same architect) as
the Guttenheim from Bilbao.
