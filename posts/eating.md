The main meal of the day in Spain is lunch. Midday in Spain is 2pm so
don't expect any restaurant to be open before then! They have the concept
of the menu del dia (menu of the day) which is a 3 course meal at
midday with wine/beer. The cost of this ranges from 15 euros to 25
euros depending if your in a tourist place or not.

At night they just usually have a small meal or order a beer and you get free tapas if
your not in Madrid, nothing really opens before 8:30 pm though!

To find the best tapas bar look for grottiest bar where there is rubbish on the bar floor where
they have thrown their toothpicks or whatever. That's where the best
tapas are!
