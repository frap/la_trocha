Avila has a massive wall around the bottom of the old town. Wroth
going up and having a walk along the walls - costs about 10 Euros.
Makes ure you buy your water before you go up as otherwise youll waste
5 euros for a water!

Good food up the hill ( and view of the walled Avila) on other side of
gully form the bottom of the walled city.
